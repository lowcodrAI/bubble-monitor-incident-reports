# Incident Report: Log Samples Creation Outage

**Date**: June 30, 2025  
**Incident ID**: INC-2025-001  
**Duration**: 10 days (June 20 - June 30, 2025)  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Resolved  

## 📋 Summary

Log samples, breadcrumbs, and error context stopped being created on June 20, 2025, while log groups continued to work normally. This resulted in a 10-day outage affecting the core monitoring capabilities of the Bubble Monitor system.

## 🎯 Impact

### Affected Systems
- ❌ **Log Samples**: Complete failure - 0 samples created
- ❌ **Breadcrumbs**: Complete failure - depends on sample creation
- ❌ **Error Context**: Complete failure - depends on sample creation
- ✅ **Log Groups**: Continued working normally
- ✅ **Session Tracking**: Continued working normally
- ✅ **N8N Webhooks**: Continued working normally

### Business Impact
- **Data Loss**: ~1,000+ missing log samples based on group creation patterns
- **Reduced Debugging Capability**: No detailed error context for 10 days
- **Monitoring Blind Spot**: Unable to track user-specific error patterns
- **User Experience**: Developers had limited error investigation tools

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Timeline
- **June 20, 2025**: Issue introduced (likely during edge function update)
- **June 20-30, 2025**: Silent failure - no samples created
- **June 30, 2025**: Issue discovered and diagnosed
- **June 30, 2025**: Fix deployed and verified

### Technical Root Cause
Invalid database column reference in the Supabase Edge Function:

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
const sampleData = {
  group_id,
  user_id,
  session_id: effectiveSessionId, // ❌ Column doesn't exist in database!
  metadata: metadata || {},
  // ...
};
```

The `monitor_log_samples` table does not have a `session_id` column, causing PostgreSQL to reject all INSERT operations with:
```
ERROR: 42703: column "session_id" of relation "monitor_log_samples" does not exist
```

### Why It Went Undetected
1. **Silent Failure**: PostgreSQL errors weren't properly logged
2. **Cascading Dependencies**: Breadcrumbs and error context depend on successful sample creation
3. **Partial System Function**: Log groups continued working, masking the issue
4. **Insufficient Monitoring**: No alerts for missing samples

## 🔧 Resolution

### Immediate Fix
Removed the invalid `session_id` field and stored it in the `metadata` JSON field instead:

```javascript
// FIXED CODE
const sampleData = {
  group_id,
  user_id,
  // session_id: effectiveSessionId, // ❌ REMOVED
  metadata: {
    ...(metadata || {}),
    session_id: effectiveSessionId // ✅ Store in metadata JSON
  },
  // ...
};
```

### Additional Improvements
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added detailed logging for sample insertion
2. **Success Logging**: Track when samples are created successfully
3. **Better Error Recovery**: Continue processing other payloads on failure

## 🛡️ Prevention Measures

### Short-term
1. **✅ Enhanced Logging**: Deployed improved error handling and logging
2. **✅ Schema Validation**: Verify edge function code matches database schema
3. **🔄 Monitoring Setup**: Create alerts for missing samples (in progress)

### Long-term
1. **Database Migrations**: Formal migration process for schema changes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test edge functions against actual database schema
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into all system components
4. **Automated Alerts**: Proactive notification of system failures

## 📊 Debugging Process

### Investigation Steps
1. **Symptom Analysis**: Confirmed groups created ✅, samples not created ❌
2. **Authentication Check**: Verified `window.bubble_session_uid` working
3. **RLS Investigation**: Initially suspected Row Level Security issues
4. **Schema Analysis**: Discovered missing `session_id` column
5. **Error Reproduction**: Confirmed PostgreSQL column error

### Key Diagnostic Queries
```sql
-- Confirmed no samples since June 20th
SELECT DATE(created_at) as sample_date, COUNT(*) as samples_count
FROM monitor_log_samples 
WHERE created_at >= '2025-06-20'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
-- Result: 0 rows

-- Verified groups still being created  
SELECT DATE(created_at) as group_date, COUNT(*) as groups_count
FROM monitor_log_groups 
WHERE created_at >= '2025-06-20'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
-- Result: 120+ groups created during outage
```

## 📈 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- **Systematic Debugging**: Methodical approach to isolate the issue
- **Quick Resolution**: Once identified, fix was simple and immediate
- **System Resilience**: Core functionality (groups) continued working

### What Could Be Improved
- **Early Detection**: Need monitoring for missing samples
- **Error Visibility**: Better logging could have caught this immediately
- **Testing**: Schema validation in deployment process
- **Documentation**: Keep schema docs up to date
